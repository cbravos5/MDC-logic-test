# MDC Logic Test

## Description

This respository consists in a list with 8 logic problems to be solved using any language.
Each file has the description of the problem in its header, followed by the solution.

## Why C?

First, C is one of the fastest languages out there, which makes compute-intensive operations faster to solve. Second its I/O interface makes it easy to use prompt user interactions.
Finaly, C is the first language I used to solve logic problems, which led me to use it as I'm more used to it.

## How to Execute?

First run

```bash
make
```

to compile all C files.

Then, you could run 

```bash
./desired-file
```

to execute the solution you wanna see.
